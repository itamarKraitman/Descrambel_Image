To solve this assignment, I used image processing tools using openCV library, alongside with numPy and sqllite3.
Firstly, I created a connection the SQLite database, and retrieve all the rows (tiles) in form of list of tuples, where each tuple is a tile.
I did not make any manipulations (order by and such) because I noticed that the destination x and y coordinates are originally organized in ascending order, so iterating over the list is efficient enough.
Secondly, I treated each tile as a separate image, so the descrambled and scrambled images are actually made of 24*24 smaller images.
For each tile, I seperated source, destination coordinates, and rotation from each other. Then captured the tile **itself** from the scrambled image using numpy indexing (can be done also with multy threading, but in my opinion, it is not necessary in this assignment), rotate it to the original image angle, and place it in the descrambled image.
